<h2>Kitchen Recipes</h2>

<p>Puerto Rican cuisine adopted a few Spanish dishes during the Spanish colonialization of Puerto Rico. From my own Puerto Rican upbringing, I learned that there was a a weekly menu of dishes we cooked and then there were the dishes only for Three Kings Day and other religious holidays.</p>

There are now more modern variations of dishes. For example, Pernil or pork roast, is specifically for Christmas or the Three Kings Day, but is now used for most holidays. Flan de Queso, which is Flan made of cream cheese is now Flancocho. Flancocho is a combination of Flan and Bizcocho (cake). Both the Flan and the cake are baked together which creates a smooth and creamy top layer on top of a spongy yellow cake. The ingredients used for Puerto Rican dishes tend to use indigenous food items, but most can be found on the mainland.</p>

<h2>Did you know?</h2>

<p>Arroz con gandules is an infusion of Spanish paella and an Indian legume. The pigeon pea is a native legume of India and has been cultivated there for hundreds of years. If you compare Spanish paella with arroz con gandules you can see the colorful similarities despite the differences in spices. There is no heat in most Puertorican dishes unless that's something you prefer.The way you can tell if an arroz con gandules is authentically Puerto Rican is by the bright orange color created by the use of annatto see or oil. </p>

      <li>In a large pot or caldero, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add sofrito, tomato sauce, sazÃ³n, adobo, and oregano. SautÃ© for 3â€“5 minutes until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add gandules and olives. Stir and cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add rinsed rice and mix thoroughly so it absorbs the seasonings.</li>
      <li>Pour in chicken broth (or water) and add bay leaves. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
      <li>Bring to a gentle boil, uncovered. Let it boil until most of the liquid is absorbed (about 8â€“10 minutes).</li>
