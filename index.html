My name is Maria. As an Army brat, Iâ€™ve lived everywhere, but deep down I will always be a Boricua Southern Girl. I enjoy learning about culture and food so why not put them together.
I am a licensed high school Business teacher. As a kid, I traveled around with my military family. When my father retired from the service, we hunkered down in NC, but I never forgot my Caribbean roots. I never forgot the food I grew up with and traveled with it everywhere we went. Food was home.

  While I was working on my yard with my Dad, it was about 93 degrees outside. I was spent after about an hour and a half, but my father kept going. My Dad is 71 so I asked him how was he tolerating the heat so well? He responded with this: "My great-grandfather, my grandfather and my father all worked in the heat cutting sugar cane. I guess that's where I get it." There is no heat in Puertorican food. It is flavorful and well seasoned. No need for heat unless it's your preference.
